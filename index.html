<h1 align="center">Kerala Blasters</h1>
<img src="k.jpg" width="device-width" style="align-items: center;">
<h2 width=device-width;> Kerala Blasters Football Club, commonly referred to as The Blasters, is an Indian professional football club based in Kochi, Kerala, that competes in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top tier of football in India. The club was established in May 2014 during the inaugural season of the Indian Super League.

The club played their inaugural match on 13 October 2014, losing 1–0 to NorthEast United. The Blasters are the three-time runners-up of the Indian Super League. They first entered the final in 2014, where they lost 1–0 to ATK after an injury-time goal from them. In 2016, they were again defeated 4–3 by ATK, this time through penalties in the final. The club entered the final for the third time in 2022, where they were defeated 3–1 by Hyderabad FC through penalties. The Blasters play home games at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi. In most of the seasons since the club's founding, Kerala Blasters have held the record for the highest league attendance, regularly attracting spectators of over 30,000 per game. The Blasters share a rivalry with fellow South Indian neighbours Bengaluru FC and Chennaiyin FC, with whom they contest in the South Indian Derby.

The Blasters are one of the most widely supported clubs in Asia and have one of the largest social media following among football clubs from the continent. The club is also known for their fan base, including the supporters group called Manjappada, which has gained a reputational for being one of the most vocal and passionate fan clubs in Asia. The club's crest features an elephant holding a football with its trunk, denoting Kerala's deep connection with the sport. The club's traditional kit consists of a yellow and blue colour scheme, with yellow being the primary colour and identity of the club ever since the beginning.</h2>

<p style="font-size: x-large;""> <h1>What’s at stake?</h1>
Kerala Blasters made the most compelling impact in terms of social media influence, and stadium attendance for all the seasons in Indian Super League, regardless of the results they produced in each season. A club who are ranked 70th in the world in social media following will be a tough reckoning for all stakeholders who are involved with the club. This is one of the most significant pressure Kerala Blasters face in each of their season’s where expectations of the massive fan base will always be high which in turn puts the club and players under scrutiny all the time.

The season will be tough based on multiple key factors especially with the inclusion of I-League champions Punjab FC who are thriving to prove their way into the top of Indian football’s elite league competition. Apart from that, ISL will be having familiar faces as head coaches who has the history of clinching the ISL shield and winners trophy in the past including Spaniards Sergio Lobera and Carles Caudrat, which will be a tough ask for the team led by Ivan Vukomanovic. With the Serbian coach suspended for the first three games, assistant coach Frank Dauwan will be in charge of the team.

<h1>Transfer Activity</h1>
The summer transfer window just gone by is by far one of the best for Kerala Blasters in terms of bringing in high potential talents as well as experienced campaigners to their ranks ahead of a crucial season. There was some serious discussions about how Blasters will approach the transfer window especially after being fined Rs.4cr for breaching football rules in last season’s semi-final playoff game against Bengaluru FC.

But, surprisingly KBFC paved their own approach, a distinct and unique one, pulling strings to grab the signatures of their most important targets and then potential future stars. Karolys Skinkys, Sporting Director of KBFC, who is in charge of transfer activities, has managed to work in the given budget to bring in top targets to reinforce the team to the next level.

In’s: Sagolsem Bikash Singh, Jaushua Sotirio, Emmanuel Justine, Prabir Das, Naocha Singh, Lara Sharma, Pritam Kotal, Ishan Pandita, Freddy Lallawmawma, Aiban Dohling, Milos Drincic, Kwame Peprah, and Daisuke Sakai.

Out’s: Harmanjot Khabra, Muheet Shabir, Denechandra Meitei, Ayush Adhikari, Prabhsukhan Gill, Sahal Abdul Samad, Jessel Carneiro, Victor Mongil, Apostolos Giannou, Ivan Kaliyuzhni and Givson Singh, Nishu Kumar, Sagolsem Bikash Singh, Bijoy Varghese, Muhammad Ajsal, and Emmanuel Justine (Loan).

<h1>Kerala Blasters FC Season Preview 2022-23</h1>
Kerala Blasters have received good amount of money in terms of transfer fee from the transfers of Sahal Abdul Samad, Prabhsukhan Gill and also a noteworthy wage reduction by releasing high salary players like Nishu Kumar. On the flip side, they have splashed more than decent money to land in Aiban Dohling and Pritam Kotal to their fortress. Apart from that, they have loaned out high potential prospects like Bikash, Bijoy to I-League clubs to gain more experience and match time.

One convincing point is the reduction in the average age of foreign players to 27.5 years and overall squad age to 24.9 years.

<h1>Strengths</h1>
When compared to previous season, Kerala Blasters has massively improved their squad depth to an extend where they have multiple options in single position. Most importantly, many of their players possess the attribute of versatility in their playing style which allows the head coach to have serious options on the table to choose from which was the major lacking point for the last few seasons.

Additions of experienced campaigners like Pritam Kotal, Prabir Das, Aiban Dohling and Ishan Pandita will be monumental as season progresses. In terms of foreign contingent, players like Peprah, Milos and Daisuke are young with high potential. As things stand, defensive compartment packs the best firepower with midfield having numerous options to choose from including Luna, Daisuke, Rahul, Jeakson, Danish, Vibin and newly added Freddy.

On the attacking compartment, Dimitrios Diamantakos who racked up ten goals last season will play a vital role again for the Blasters. Apart from him, creative play-maker Adrian Luna, will definitely be the most important piece of puzzle for the team in yellow.

<h1>Weaknesses</h1>
One of the foremost area Kerala Blasters are in urgent need to tackle is the lack of goal scoring or creative Indian winger. It is now persistently visible how Kerala Blasters struggle to find creative channels in the field apart from the combinations set by foreign players like Luna and Dimitrios especially with the departure of their star player Sahal Abdul Samad to Mohun Bagan.

Another area to improve is to find their way to finish off the key chances they create where goal conversion rate of the team in Yellow was 11% last season. It is to be seen how things could change with the addition of players like Ishan and Daisuke, while players like Rahul and Bryce Miranda should step up when needed.
